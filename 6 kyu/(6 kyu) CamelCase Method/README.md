# CamelCase Method

https://www.codewars.com/kata/camelcase-method

Write simple .camelCase method (`camel_case` function in PHP, `CamelCase` in C# or `camelCase` in Java) for strings. All words must have their first letter capitalized without spaces.

For instance:

```javascript
CamelCase("hello case")      // => "HelloCase"
CamelCase("camel case word") // => "CamelCaseWord"
```
