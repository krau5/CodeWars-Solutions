# Nuclear Missile Manager

https://www.codewars.com/kata/nuclear-missile-manager

Our nuclear missile manager system is coded in Node.js. We are currently testing the system and it seems that the `launchAll` function does not work as expected. It should launch 5 missiles each 1 second apart. The current code tries to launch the missile #5 five times...

Can you fix this for us? You know, it's pretty critical code...

**Note**: There are 5 missiles labeled i which is a number in {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}. The missile `i` should be launched after `i` seconds.
