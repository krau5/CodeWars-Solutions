# Srot the inner ctonnet in dsnnieedcg oredr

You have to sort the inner content of every word of a string in descending order.

The inner content is the content of a word without first and the last char.

Some examples:

```
"sort the inner content in descending order"  -->  "srot the inner ctonnet in dsnnieedcg oredr"
"wait for me"        -->  "wiat for me"
"this kata is easy"  -->  "tihs ktaa is esay"
```

Words are made up of lowercase letters.

The string will never be null and will never be empty. In C/C++ the string is always nul-terminated.

Have fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-)
