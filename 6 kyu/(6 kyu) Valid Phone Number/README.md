# Valid Phone Number

https://www.codewars.com/kata/valid-phone-number

Write a function that accepts a string, and returns true if it is in the form of a phone number.
Assume that any integer from 0-9 in any of the spots will produce a valid phone number.

Only worry about the following format:
(123) 456-7890 (don't forget the space after the close parentheses)

Examples:

```
"(123) 456-7890"  => true
"(1111)555 2345"  => false
"(098) 123 4567"  => false
```
